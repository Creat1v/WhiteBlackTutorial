WhiteBlack Shooter
==================

WhiteBlack Shooter is an ongoing project designed to teach game development and intermediate game production techniques at an accelerated rate using the FlashPunk game library.

It is completely open-source, but is best used in conjunction with the videos that can be found at http://vimeo.com/channels/makingflashpunkgames. Episode 9 is the first video to begin work on WhiteBlack Shooter.
